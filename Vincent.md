  # Vietnamese Phobo

  ## Ingredients
  - 200g Vietnamese rice noodles
  - 2 kg of beef
  - aromatic spices: cinnamon, ginger, star anise, pepper, black cardamom.
  -  1 tablespoon coriander seeds  
  - 1 tablespoon salt  
  - 2 tablespoons fish sauce  
  - 4 liters of water.

    ## Cooking Steps
- **Clean the bones and meat**: Boil water for 5 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse with clean water.
- Toast the spices (cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, coriander seeds) in a dry pan until fragrant. Put them in a spice bag or cheesecloth.
-  Add grilled onion, ginger, and spice bag into the pot.
- Simmer the broth for **at least 4 hours**. Skim off foam and fat regularly.
- After 1.5–2 hours, remove the brisket and let it cool. Slice it thinly for serving.
- Add salt and fish sauce to taste. Strain the broth before serving.
- **Prepare the noodles**: Soak and cook rice noodles according to the package instructions.
- **To serve**: Place noodles in a bowl, top with sliced brisket, pour hot broth over, and garnish with green onions, cilantro, and fresh herbs.

**Tip:**  
**Char the onion and ginger** over an open flame or in a hot pan — this gives the broth its rich, smoky flavor.  
**Do not rush the simmering process** — slow cooking develops the deep, clear broth that makes pho special.
